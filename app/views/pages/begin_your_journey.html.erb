            I'm an aerialist and my performances and practice requires a lot from me physically. I started taking group classes to help with my training, and later on signed up for nutrition counseling. I've never felt healthier or stronger, and at 30 years old, I look better than I did 5 years ago.

            <p>
              I started CrossFit  in January of 2017 . After being sedentary for over three years, I started taking group classes. I made TONS of progress and although I love group classes, I wanted to test my limits and compete in local competitions. I started individual design with Coach Bunn and since then have competed several times locally and finished in the top ten each time. Thanks to Cigar City I can finally say that I compete in a sport!

              I started Individual Design with Coach Arielle almost 9 Months ago. I had done CrossFit before, but I had trouble with accountability and was ready for a big change in my life. I couldn't be happier with the results, it‚Äôs literally turned my life around.
