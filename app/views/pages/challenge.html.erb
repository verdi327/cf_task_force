                    When I made the appointment to talk to Michael at Cigar City Crossfit he contacted me right away. I still was a little hesitant because I was so out of shape. When I arrived Michael and Ben were so welcoming and took the time to chat with me about what to expect. The first week was extremely challenging, I just remember coach Ben saying just walk through the door and show up and we will get you through it. So, I continued to just walk through the door and show up. I put in my best effort and I can see and feel changes every week.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The best is they make me feel like I belong there and always acknowledge me by my NAME when I get there for class. I love this place, for one hour I forget about everything going on in my crazy life and get a great workout. Not only do they focus on the technique of the movements but they have helped me make changes in my diet and go over nutrition. Plus they're pretty funny and are always making me laugh.

                    The 6 week challenge gave me the push I needed to start my fitness routine. At first I was intimidated by Crossfit, however the coaches were so encouraging. Crossfit WILL make you look and feel better. My focus shifted from the weight on the scale to the weight on the bar; how much I can deadlift, clean and push-press.

                <p>
                    This challenge was created to introduce CrossFit to a broader population.  We have personally seen how CrossFit can dramatically change the lives of those who commit to the process.  This challenge was created to introduce CrossFit to those who would absolutely benefit from the training, but who may be too intimidated to come out and try it on their own.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are trying to find the right women who will work hard, finish the full 6 weeks, and ultimately be an amazing representation of what is possible through CrossFit training.  If this sounds like something you would like to be a part of, fill out an application ASAP.  We always fill up quickly.  We look forward to meeting you in person very soon.
