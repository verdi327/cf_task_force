                    Previously, I was in the Air Force and living in Washington, DC.  I was a bit nervous moving as I didn't know anyone in Tampa. I joined Cigar City CrossFit and it's been the best decision I've made since arriving.  The gym is massive with tons of new equipment.  Ben and Mike are some of the best coaches I've ever been around.  Each of them have their own style and it's funny watching them interact.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Oh, and the results speak for themselves.  I'm the strongest and leanest I've ever been and that's including my Air Force days.  If you're looking to get great results while being surrounded by welcoming, like-minded people - this is the gym to train at!
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">

                <p>
                    From the moment I walked into the facility, I was welcomed. You don't have that at a lot of gyms. From the first workout I was challenged, motivated, and encouraged. From the first failure, I was boosted up and reminded that it takes time. Failure is not something permanent, it's a chance to do better. Coach Benjamin and Coach Mike offer different styles of coaching so there's quite literally something for everyone. But all of the Cigar City CrossFit coaches are there 300% - focusing on each member and taking the time to listen to their goals.  Simply put, they care.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's not about how fast or strong you are today, it's about making health and fitness a part of your lifestyle. So, if you show up, check your ego at the door and open your mind to try something new, you'll be amazed at the results. Completing the 6 Week Challenge and then becoming a member of Cigar City CrossFit has definitely been the best thing I've done since moving to Tampa.

                    The 6 Week CrossFit Challenge is AMAZING! What started out as a 6 week challenge to restart my fitness routine, has quickly turned into a lifestyle for me. With the help and encouragement of great coaches, I not only completed the six weeks challenge, but I also became a Cigar City CrossFit member. I am forever grateful to the coaches of Cigar City CrossFit for their continuous dedication to helping me become the best athlete I can be.  And with them, I feel like I've joined a family, not just another gym!
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, if you're tired of doing the same old workout routine or if your just looking to get healthy again, this is your ticket.  CrossFit can be intimidating, but Ben and Mike make you feel welcomed from moment you walk through the door.

                    The 6 Week CrossFit Challenge was awesome! I committed myself to the eating plan and made almost every workout.  The energy, the enthusiasm from the coaches and the other athletes is like nothing I have ever felt in a gym before.

                <p>
                    There were definitely days when I was sore and tired and didn't want to come but I remember the coaches saying "just show up and we'll take care of the rest".  Well, I showed up and worked hard and I'm happy with the results I achieved!

                <p>
                    This challenge was created to introduce CrossFit to a broader population.  We have personally seen how CrossFit can dramatically change the lives of those who commit to the process.  This challenge was created to introduce CrossFit to those who would absolutely benefit from the training, but who may be too intimidated to come out and try it on their own.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are trying to find the right men and women who will work hard, finish the full 6 weeks, and ultimately be an amazing representation of what is possible through CrossFit training.  If this sounds like something you would like to be a part of, fill out an application ASAP.  We always fill up quickly.  We look forward to meeting you in person very soon.
