                    Personal training has been a staple of the fitness industry simply because it works.  If you struggle with accountability or need help with mastering technique, personal training is the route for you.

                    As a personal training athlete, you can expect the undivided attention of a coach as he or she guides you through a workout plan that is tailored to achieve your specific goals.  We measure everything, so there is no guessing at whether or not you're getting the results you desire.

                <p>I finally made the decision to train with Cigar City CrossFit after years of falling on and off the fitness train. I had been training at LA Fitness consistently for many months until I got to this point where I was stuck! I felt like I tried everything, but I couldn't lose the weight I wanted. My girlfriend invited me to one of the free workouts on Saturday. I loved the gym vibe, but wanted a program just for me.</p>

                <p>I trained 3x per week for three months.  <strong>I lost weight, quit smoking cigarettes and started eating better (read - less drinking more veggies).</strong>  Quitting smoking was a HUGE deal for me and I'm so happy Michael kept hammering away on me to quit.  I couldn't be happier with my results in the short time I was there.  I just wish I had knew about you all sooner!</p>
