                    CrossFit classes are an awesome way to get and stay in shape.  Unlike other group training models where you only do one activity like cycling or yoga, CrossFit keeps you excited about working out by having constantly varied workouts that incorporate elements of cardio, weight training and gymnastics. 

                    Some might think CrossFit is dangerous or done only by extremely fit people.  Not so.  We have athletes of all abilities and ages and they are able to workout together because our coaches are able to scale the workouts to meet each athlete's need.  So, if you're looking for a fun and community orientated way to stay in shape, this is the ticket for you!

                <h3>Steve's Success Story</h3>
                <p>Cigar City CrossFit is my favorite place to be.  I've worked out at a few other CrossFit gyms before and I can say hands down this has been my best experience.  From the facility, the coaches, programming and other members, I've really found my home away from home.  In just five months, I've added 10lbs of muscle and increased my lifts across the board by 20%.  My deadlift is at 465lbs, my back squats at 375lbs and my Fran time is below 4 minutes.  Working out with the Cigar City CrossFit team is the best part of my day.  If you're on the fence, don't be, jump right in, it's the best decision I've made in a long time.</p>

                <h3>Grey's Success Story</h3>
                <p>I wanted to try CrossFit but I was always too intimidated to just jump in.  But, I worked up the courage and dropped into a Saturday class.  I was hooked.  Ben and Mike really focus on education and go out of their way to make sure every athlete performs safely and to the best of their individual ability. Pair that with being pushed to your max in a fun and accepting environment and you've got CrossFit gold!

                <p>This is really a fantastic CrossFit gym. They have a huge space, and the coaches are incredible. I joined - and recommend - a 6-week CrossFit program, and it was much different from any type of workout I've done. I'm excited to be a full-time member and keep getting better. I have traveled and gone to a few other places, but I'm always glad to come to my home gym.</p>
