                    Are you putting in the work at the gym but not seeing the results you hoped for?  Whether you are looking to lose weight or gain muscle the key to building a body that is lean and muscular is through your diet.  Many have asked for this service and we're happy to finally be able to deliver it.

                    You'll meet with a coach to discuss your goals and go over what your current diet consists of.  We'll ask that <strong>BEFORE</strong> you come in, you track your entire day of eating for at least <strong>TWO</strong> days.  Based on your goals, we'll create meal plans and grocery lists that fit your necessary macronutrient profile.  We'll deliver this weekly via email.  You'll have the support of a coach along the way that will be accessible via email, text and in person check-ins.

                <p>I finally made the decision to train with Cigar City CrossFit after years of falling on and off the fitness train. I had been training at LA Fitness consistently for many months until I got to this point where I was stuck! I felt like I tried everything, but I couldn't lose the weight I wanted. My girlfriend invited me to one of the free workouts on Saturday. I loved the gym vibe, but wanted a program just for me.</p>

                <p>I trained 3x per week for 6 weeks.  <strong>I lost 20lbs, quit smoking cigarettes and started eating better (read - less drinking more veggies).</strong>  Quitting smoking was a HUGE deal for me and I'm so happy Michael kept hammering away on me to quit.  I couldn't be happier with my results in the short time I was there.  I just wish I had knew about you all sooner!</p>
