                    Are you putting in the work at the gym but not seeing the results you hoped for?  Whether you are looking to lose weight or gain muscle the key to building a body that is lean and muscular is through your diet.  Many have asked for this service and we're happy to finally be able to deliver it.

                    You'll meet with a coach to discuss your goals and go over what your current diet consists of.  We ask that <strong>BEFORE</strong> you come in, you track your entire day of eating for at least <strong>TWO</strong> days.  Based on your goals and timeframe will look to upgrade your nutrition. We take a holistic approach that factors in lifestyle, sleep, food quality, hydration, digestion and macronutrient profiling.

                    You'll have the support of a coach along the way that will be accessible via email, text and in person check-ins.

                <p>I met with 9 trainers from the Tampa/St Pete area. When I met Kristen without even knowing her I felt instant trust and feeling that it meant a lot to her to help me reach my goals. Kristen put a plan together for ME. She got to know me first through an in-depth questionnaire so she could tailor the plan to me. This was great because I’m a picky eater and have a crazy schedule.
                </p> 

                <p>I’m two months into the coaching and am seeing great results and feel a million times better. I don’t want to say it’s “easy” to follow because it was hard at first with my old bad lifestyle but she makes it so you still enjoy life. She sends out follow up emails, checks in to see how I'm feeling etc and has a wealth of knowledge. Knowledge that the average person just doesn't have when it comes to that field. I would highly recommend her to handle any nutrition needs.</p>
