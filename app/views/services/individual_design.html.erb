                        For those in search of an individualized program, the traditional route has been personal training. However, personal training is costly and at some point no longer needed once the athlete has a firm technical grasp.  We created individual design as a means to facilitate more people getting the benefits of individualized programming without having to pay for a coach's time every session.
                    
                        We still complete an assessment and formulate a tailored plan, the difference being the program is completed on the athlete's own time during open gym hours vs during a previously set appointment with a coach.

                    I've been training CrossFit consistently for about two years before starting on an individual design with Coach Mike at Cigar City CrossFit.  My goals are to make the CrossFit Regionals in 2018.  To meet those goals, I needed a program that centered around me, that focused on my weaknesses and that fit around my schedule. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Coach Mike is super knowledgeable and within the first two months I've already seen tremedous gains in my overall fitness.  I've PR'ed my back squat, deadlift, snatch and clean and jerk.  I've also increased my aerobic capacity significantly.  My Fran time dropped from 2:57 to 2:30.  I couldn't be happier with my decision.  I feel like I'm on actual path forward instead of just coming in and exercising myself to death.
